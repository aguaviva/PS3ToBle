## NAME CHANGE IN LIBRARAY MANAGER - PLEASE READ
Hi all DIY gaming enthusiasts.
Please be aware that the official name for this library in the library manager has changed from
	
	ESP32 BLE Gamepad  -->  ESP32-BLE-Gamepad

This is to make it consistent with those who were also downloading it from GitHub and had 2 versions with different names and was leading to confusion.
The library manager was automatically renaming the folder ESP32_BLE_Gamepad upon installation due to the spaces in the name. The library with the old name has been de-listed from the manager and only the new one remains.
Please remove/delete the old version by deleting the ESP32_BLE_Gamepad folder within your libraries folder.

Apologies for the early adopters, but it will save a lot of confusion moving forward.

## Configurable HID ##
Since version 3, this library supports a configurable HID desciptor, which allows users to customise how the device presents itself to the OS (number of buttons, hats, ases, sliders, simulation controls etc).
See the examples for guidance.

# ESP32-BLE-Gamepad

## License
Published under the MIT license. Please see license.txt

## Features

 - [x] Button press (128 buttons)
 - [x] Button release (128 buttons)
 - [x] Axes movement (6 axes (16 bit) (x, y, z, rZ, rX, rY) --> (Left Thumb X, Left Thumb Y, Right Thumb X, Right Thumb Y, Left Trigger, Right Trigger))
 - [x] 2 Sliders (16 bit) (Slider 1 and Slider 2)
 - [x] 4 point of view hats (ie. d-pad plus 3 other hat switches)
 - [x] Simulation controls (rudder, throttle, accelerator, brake, steering)
 - [x] Configurable HID descriptor
 - [x] Report optional battery level to host (basically works, but it doesn't show up in Android's status bar)
 - [x] Customize Bluetooth device name/manufacturer
 - [x] Uses efficient NimBLE bluetooth library
 - [x] Compatible with Windows
 - [x] Compatible with Android (Android OS maps default buttons / axes / hats slightly differently than Windows)
 - [x] Compatible with Linux (limited testing)
 - [x] Compatible with MacOS X (limited testing)
 - [ ] Compatible with iOS (No - not even for accessibility switch - This is not a “Made for iPhone” (MFI) compatible device)

## Installation
- (Make sure you can use the ESP32 with the Arduino IDE. [Instructions can be found here.](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32#installation-instructions))
- [Download the latest release of this library from the release page.](https://github.com/lemmingDev/ESP32-BLE-Gamepad/releases)
- In the Arduino IDE go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .ZIP Library..." and select the file you just downloaded.
- You can now go to "File" -> "Examples" -> "ESP32 BLE Gamepad" and select an example to get started.

## Example

``` C++
/*
 * This example turns the ESP32 into a Bluetooth LE gamepad that presses buttons and moves axis
 * 
 * Possible buttons are:
 * BUTTON_1 through to BUTTON_16 
 * (16 buttons supported by default. Library can be configured to support up to 128)
 * 
 * Possible DPAD/HAT switch position values are: 
 * DPAD_CENTERED, DPAD_UP, DPAD_UP_RIGHT, DPAD_RIGHT, DPAD_DOWN_RIGHT, DPAD_DOWN, DPAD_DOWN_LEFT, DPAD_LEFT, DPAD_UP_LEFT
 * (or HAT_CENTERED, HAT_UP etc)
 *
 * bleGamepad.setAxes takes the following int16_t parameters for the Left/Right Thumb X/Y, Left/Right Triggers plus slider1 and slider2, and hat switch position as above: 
 * (Left Thumb X, Left Thumb Y, Right Thumb X, Right Thumb Y, Left Trigger, Right Trigger, Hat switch position 
 ^ (1 hat switch (dpad) supported by default. Library can be configured to support up to 4)
 *
 * Library can also be configured to support up to 5 simulation controls (can be set with setSimulationControls)
 * (rudder, throttle, accelerator, brake, steering), but they are not enabled by default.

#include <BleGamepad.h> 

BleGamepad bleGamepad;

void setup() 
{
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println("Starting BLE work!");
  bleGamepad.begin();
  // The default bleGamepad.begin() above is the same as bleGamepad.begin(16, 1, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, false, false, false, false, false);
  // which enables a gamepad with 16 buttons, 1 hat switch, enabled x, y, z, rZ, rX, rY, slider 1, slider 2 and disabled rudder, throttle, accelerator, brake, steering
  // Auto reporting is enabled by default. 
  // Use bleGamepad.setAutoReport(false); to disable auto reporting, and then use bleGamepad.sendReport(); as needed
}

void loop() 
{
  if(bleGamepad.isConnected()) 
  {
    Serial.println("Press buttons 5 and 16. Move all enabled axes to max. Set DPAD (hat 1) to down right.");
    bleGamepad.press(BUTTON_5);
    bleGamepad.press(BUTTON_16);
    bleGamepad.setAxes(32767, 32767, 32767, 32767, 32767, 32767, 32767, 32767, DPAD_DOWN_RIGHT);
    // All axes, sliders, hats etc can also be set independently. See the IndividualAxes.ino example
    delay(500);

    Serial.println("Release button 5. Move all axes to min. Set DPAD (hat 1) to centred.");
    bleGamepad.release(BUTTON_5);
    bleGamepad.setAxes(-32767, -32767, -32767, -32767, -32767, -32767, -32767, -32767, DPAD_CENTERED);
    delay(500);
  }
}
```
By default, reports are sent on every button press/release or axis/slider/hat/simulation movement, however this can be disabled, and then you manually call sendReport on the gamepad instance as shown in the IndividualAxes.ino example.

There is also Bluetooth specific information that you can use (optional):

Instead of `BleGamepad bleGamepad;` you can do `BleGamepad bleGamepad("Bluetooth Device Name", "Bluetooth Device Manufacturer", 100);`.
The third parameter is the initial battery level of your device. To adjust the battery level later on you can simply call e.g.  `bleGamepad.setBatteryLevel(50)` (set battery level to 50%).
By default the battery level will be set to 100%, the device name will be `ESP32 BLE Gamepad` and the manufacturer will be `Espressif`.

## Notes
This library allows you to make the ESP32 act as a Bluetooth Gamepad and control what it does.  

Use [this](http://www.planetpointy.co.uk/joystick-test-application/) Windows test app to test/see all of the buttons
